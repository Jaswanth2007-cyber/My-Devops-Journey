# 🧩 Docker Compose

This folder contains files related to **Docker Compose** and its integration
with **Docker** and **Dockerfile**.

---

## What this folder contains

- **docker-compose.yml**  
  A simple Docker Compose YAML file that defines and runs multiple containers
  together.

  This file shows:
  - Basic structure of a Compose file
  - How services are defined
  - How Docker images and Dockerfiles are used inside Compose

- **Docker & Dockerfile**

- The **docker & Dockerfile.md** (present in the `docker/` folder) defines how an image is built
- Docker Compose uses that image to run containers
- A **simple Dockerfile structure** is created and explained in the `docker/` folder
- A **simple docker-compose.yml structure** is created here to run those containers

Detailed explanations of:
- Docker
- Dockerfile
- Image vs Container
- Ports and logs  

are documented inside the **`docker/` folder**.

---

## Purpose

This folder is used to practice running **multi-container applications**
using Docker Compose, while keeping detailed Docker and Dockerfile explanations
separate for clarity.
